            <h2>Professional web developer</h2>
            <p>My name is Safwan Ishrak. I am from Chittagong, which is a very popular district in Bangladesh. I am a very simple person. I am studying Computer Science and Telecommunication Engineering at Noakhali Science and Technology University. I have lots of dreams. I am very enthusiastic about tech, which is why I am studying Computer Science. Recently, I have completed many courses, including Writing, Running, and Fixing Code in C and C++, Programming with Python, etc. Now, I have enrolled at Programming Hero to learn web development. I am very excited.</p>

            <p>I've mastered HTML and CSS, so now it's time to level up. I'll build a personal portfolio to practice responsive design and CSS frameworks, a blog platform to learn JavaScript and SEO, and an e-commerce site to dive into backend integration, APIs, and security. These projects will deepen my skills and expand my portfolio. Let's get started!</p>
